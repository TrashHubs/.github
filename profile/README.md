# Capstone Bangkit Academy TrashHub

## Overview

<p align="justify">
"TrashHub" is a project that started with an observation of the waste management problem in Indonesia. Our team analyzed data about the problem. We found that one of the main problems is that people do not know what can be recycled. Also, people do not know how to dispose of waste properly. Our project plan includes technology development, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation to measure the impact. With the support of an experienced team and collaboration with relevant partners, we believe this project will make a significant contribution to waste management and recycling in Indonesia.
